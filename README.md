# E.D.A.-and-Data-Visualizations-with-Python-
# Womart EDA Analysis
## Overview
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project leverages powerful Python tools to uncover insights and trends within retail sales data. Designed to showcase analytical and visualization expertise, this project identifies top-performing stores, investigates sales trends, and provides insights on data distributions, enabling a deeper understanding of retail data dynamics.

Through this project, I apply data science skills in data wrangling, preprocessing, and insightful visualizations, making it an ideal demonstration of my analytical abilities for potential employers.

## Project Goals
- **Analyze and Clean Data**: Assess data quality, handle missing values, and ensure consistency for effective analysis.
- **Visualize Key Insights**: Create targeted visualizations to spotlight trends, sales peaks, and store performance.
- **Develop Scalable Data Solutions**: Implement scalable and reproducible code, utilizing best practices to ensure maintainability and flexibility.
## Key Skills Demonstrated
-** Data Preprocessing**: Addressed missing data and duplicate records to streamline dataset analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA**): Comprehensive insights into store performance, sales metrics, and sales trends using clear and concise data visualization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhanced the dataset by encoding variables and adjusting data types for improved performance in future modeling phases.
- **Data Visualization Proficienc**y: Used matplotlib, seaborn, and proplot for visually compelling insights, including custom color schemes and annotations for clarity.
## Tech Stack
-** Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Proplot, Scipy, LightGBM
-** Visualization Techniques**: Customized bar plots, annotated charts, and categorical color schemes to highlight high-performing stores and identify outliers.
